## Data:
- 20241020_data_yield.csv is the "rawest" yield data set. It is a direct output from Google Earth Engine with the properties from the original dataset. 
- 20241027_data_yield.csv is the data before the step "(II) Transform the data" in the markdown. It is so to say a clean version of 20241020_data_yield.csv. 
- 20241027_data_processed.csv is the result of processing - "reg.data" in the markdown. So this data set only has 1394 rows, because those are already aggregated measurements. 
(Some csv files had to be uploaded in the zip format, because they were too big for usual github upload)

**old_data:** is a folder with older data from July and August 2024.
